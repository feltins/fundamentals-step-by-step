# The Many Gaitas

Across the ocean, the word *gaita* bends like a reed in the wind.

In Galicia and Asturias, it is a bagpipe: a drone of breath and goatskin, leading pilgrimages and holding villages together in one long note.  
In Maracaibo, it is not an instrument but a song — a communal *gaita* sung to the Virgin, half prayer and half protest, demanding dignity from power.  
On the Caribbean coast of Colombia, it is a pair of flutes weaving *cumbia* from breath and drum.  
And in the Baltics, my own ground, *gaita* is simply *gait* — one’s walk, the way a body carries itself through the world, the course of life, the rhythm of steps. **Four-T gait is my way forward after midlife anniversary.**

The English word *gait* comes from Old Norse *gata* — the path, the street, the way forward.  
In Swedish and Norwegian it still means “street.”  
In Old English there was *gaed*, meaning going, a journey, a course.  
Over time, English shifted inward: the path became the manner of walking the path.  
Latvian kept the broader sense: *dzīves gaita*, the course of life itself. *Struktūrgaita*, in turn, means the way code is running — by propagation of data.

None of these meanings are neatly connected; they are accidents of language, fragments scattered by migrations and mistranslations.  
But in that mist of accidents I find a hidden thread: in every case, *gaita* is rhythm — a pulse that organizes movement, of a people, of a procession, of a life.

So I carry this word like a compass for my own work:  
a reminder that design, art, and code are not just objects but ways of moving — collective gaits, cultural drones, accidental but alive.  

My **4T** is also a *gaita*: a walk, a song, a bagpipe, a path.  
A way of weaving breath and steps into form.
